To test the API, Run the dummy server through server.java and use curl requests or something equivalent to send HTTP requests,
or for GET requests, go to http://localhost/8080/tasks, and use requests as usual, e.g tasks/n for some task with id n, or tasks?x
where x is a filtering request for the requests in the store.
